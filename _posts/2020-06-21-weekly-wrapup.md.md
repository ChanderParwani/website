I look at a lot of different articles and posts each week, most coming in through RSS feeds. Anything that comes into my feed that I think is interesting I flag to read later on. At the end of each week I look through what I checked out during the week. These are some of the interesting articles I came across this week:

## On the Black Lives Matter Movement and Police Brutality [link](https://uncoverdc.com/2020/06/12/uc-berkeley-history-professors-open-letter-against-blm-police-brutality-and-cultural-orthodoxy/)

An interesting counterdiscussion piece to the mainstream discourse. The line that really stands out to me though is _"... you mentioned our pledge to diversity, but I am increasingly alarmed by the absence of diversity of opinion on the topic of the recent protests..."_. It's something that seems to be happening across a number of topics, not just BLM. The acceptance of a diversity of opinion seems to be disappearing and the ability of two sides to have differing viewpoints is less tolerated. I've started to actively search out counterdiscussion where I can for issues that are so incredibly charged, in hopes of understanding each side. For me, this allows me to see the flaws in each sides arguments and form a personal opinion that I can justify and comprehend, not just one that I'm told I must support.

## On Niches [link](https://stratechery.com/2020/never-ending-niches/) [link](https://theotherlifenow.com/how-i-made-3300-on-a-short-niche-philosophy-book/)

Two articles on the power of catering to a niche market instead of a broad market. One covering a theory of niches and the decline in the market relevance of broad-coverage media and one detailing the actions of serving content to a niche market. It just goes to show that there are unlimited niches out there, any of which could be profitable given the right focus.

## On Political Opinions and the American Press [link](https://taibbi.substack.com/p/the-news-media-is-destroying-itself)

Similar to the first link, the notion of _"Your opinion is different to mine, therefore it's racist/sexist/homophobic etc."_ that expresses itself today is terrifying. The idea that the news is no longer a platform to report or discuss ideas is also a saddening loss. I believe that this is what undermines the trust of the public in the media - the constant need to politicise their stories to fit a narrative instead of reporting the facts without personal or political embellishments. Reporting is to examine all sides of the story, not just the one side you want to look at. Save that for the opinion column.

## On No-Code Platforms [link](https://vas3k.com/blog/nocode/)

I'm not a believer that no-code platforms will revolutionise the world and replace the need (or high salaries) of developers. But this did help me see how they allow for the creation of small, personalised workflows. I doubt this could ever be successful at an enterprise scale, but at a personal or SMB scale it could be.

## On SRE to Meet Reliability Challenges [link](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/management-tools/meeting-reliability-challenges-with-sre-principles)

This is an extremely relevant article for me, given my current project. The ideas and philosophy embraced by the SRE priciples are a large influence on forming my opinion on how operations should be managed and measured. Now if only there was a way to distill this down into meaningful steps for non-web-scale companies...

## On Instagram Prioritising Photos of Less-Clothed People

I get the feeling this is just an unintended consequence of two things: One, the Instagram algorithm prioritising images that include people or make people more visible due to the belief this increases engagement. So the more relative skin shown, the higher it would be ranked. Two, a positive feedback loop between someone likes a photo of someone in swimwear, so it's prioritised, meaning it's more likely to be engaged with, increasing its priority. I don't think it's malicious, just unintended.

## On Zombie Markets [link](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/economist-mohamed-el-erian-warns-about-the-risk-of-zombie-markets.html)

With my limited knowledge of the complexities of the economic machine, I'm inclined to agree with the sentiment in this article. But I disagree with the notion that we haven't seen it happen yet - after the Fed pledged to start buying corporate debt, you've now got the ability to see markets rise with no downside. If anything starts going wrong,the Fed will puchase bond offers. The market itself is now viewed as "too big to fail", regardless of the size and state of the companies that compose it.

Until next time.
