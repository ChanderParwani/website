I look at a lot of different articles and posts each week, most coming in through RSS feeds. Anything that comes into my feed that I think is interesting I flag to read later on. At the end of each week I look through what I checked out during the week. These are some of the interesting articles I came across this week:

## On the Economics of Decentralized Storage [link](https://blog.dshr.org/2020/05/economics-of-decentralized-storage.html)

It's my personal belief that there is no commercial place for blockchain technologies at present or in the foreseeable future. This is an interesting look into the economics of blockchain-powered decentralized storage and some myth-busting regarding pricing and efficiency. Personally, my opinion is that the notion of "decentralized" solutions might be true from a technical perspective, but not from a commercial or ownership perspective. A single organization decides the direction of the products development and can just as easily adjust decide to change. If suddenly the Tardigrade project (or any other organization similar) decided to change how payouts work, pivot the entire roadmap or any number of other possibilities, they would be free to do so. They merge the pull requests, they decide what is in or out.

## On the Increase in Trading and Stock Prices in the Market [link](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/have-the-record-number-of-investors-in-the-stock-market-lost-their-minds) [link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-13/wall-street-heavyweights-are-sounding-alarm-about-stock-prices)

Most market indexes have picked up since their drop in March, and it seems like there's more trading going on than ever. The speculation is that the reason behind this is people expecting or hoping for a "V-shaped" rebound of the market once lockdowns close, particularly in the USA. At best, I think that's an optimistic view and at worst I think it's delusional to think anything will go back to the way it was back in January for a long time. Unemployment has increased, whole industries have crashed, and we're likely to see a new social normal as we come out of lockdown. To me, the combination of these factors will result in a more constrained recovery, measured in years instead of weeks. With countries at different points in their Coronavirus recovery, the interconnected world as we once saw it might not look the same for a very long time.

## On How a Lower Concentration of Isopropyl Alcohol Creates a More Effective Disinfectant [link](https://blog.gotopac.com/2017/05/15/why-is-70-isopropyl-alcohol-ipa-a-better-disinfectant-than-99-isopropanol-and-what-is-ipa-used-for/)

This came as a surprise to me. I always assumed that a higher concentration of disinfectant meant more effective, it's an insightful explanation here discussing diminishing returns on the disinfection properties of IPA and the interaction of water, IPA and pathogens as part of the disinfection process

## On Risk [link](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-three-sides-of-risk/)

Quite a sobering story of those decisions we make that don't seem to matter at the time but have significant consequences. The notion of focusing on the tail-end consequences of risk is an interesting idea, something certainly worth considering. But as mentioned at the end of the article, often we don't consider that tail-end consequences as they seem so unlikely we either don't think of them or discard them as possbily happening. Black swan events are the result of tail-end consequences, often devastating in their impact. But if we go through lives fearing every .001% chance that the worst would happen, we'd never leave the house or do anything.

## On Team Strucures in Technology Companies [link](http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2020/05/19/abc/)

I like the idea of creating a demarcation between infrastructure and product teams, it makes sense to me. Fundamentally they serve two different customers. The infra team serve the business, the product team server the external consumers. But this also highlights a more important concept in that a company is only as strong as its foundations. It's a fruitless endeavour to try and fix problems upstream, you need to reinforce the foundations on which it is built first.

## On Identities [link](https://secondbreakfast.co/i-am-nothing-and-also-something)

A short but provoking post on the identities we assume and how we can use these concepts to improve ourselves.
