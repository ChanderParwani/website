A couple of days ago the NSW government detailed when gyms and studios would be able to reopen. It's been the announcement I've been waiting for since March when we first went into lockdown. More than being able to see friends, got to restaurants or travel, I've wanted to be able to get back into my exercise and classes, which were things that had been helping me immensely during the year.

With almost zero hesitation, I'd already booked out my weeks. Right now I'll be doing the following each day:

* __Monday__: Aerials
* __Tuesday__: Rock Climbing
* __Wednesday__: At the moment, a rest day. Although I imagine that will change
* __Thursday__: Aerials
* __Friday__: Pub. Or dinner with friends. Or something along those lines
* __Saturday__: SCUBA Diving
* __Sunday__: Hiking

Surprisingly enough, this still leaves me with enough time to work for ~40 hours a week, hopefully get to the gym two or three times a week and maintain a social life. If I really tried, I could probably get an extra climb or dive in each week too, but right now I'm wanting to ease into things (HA).

It's been an unexpected benefit of this lockdown, seeing just how much time I have in a day. While I was always doing things before the lockdown started, I don't think I ever truly appreciated the amount of time I had in my life, or perhaps appreciated the value of not being busy either. While I'm extremely excited about being able to kick everything back into gear and start my new routine, I want to also be able to give myself time and space to myself too. I think in the past I was uncomfortable with being in my own company, or at least being in my own company in the space I was living in. They say a change is as good as a holiday, and moving houses every few months is as much a change as any. The newfound clarity every time I go somewhere and settle in is, for me, very cleansing. The small epiphanies you discover every time never cease to amaze me.

It strikes me whenever I think about theses posts that they might not always make sense or be completely coherent. That's almost by design of how I write them - I don't think, I don't plan, I don't edit. I just write and put my thoughts on the page. Once I have them written down, I submit it for the world to see. I'm not sure who reads these posts, or if anyone does at all. But I enjoy the process of writing them and the personal insight I get from them. It's like a journal, almost. Except the whole world can see it and I'm not journalling about anything in particular. Having never journalled, I don't know if that's the right way to do it, but I enjoy it all nonetheless.
