I look at a lot of different articles and posts each week, most coming in through RSS feeds. Anything that comes into my feed that I think is interesting I flag to read later on. At the end of each week I look through what I checked out during the week. These are some of the interesting articles I came across this week:

## On the Bankruptcy Proceedings for Hertz [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/business/hertz-bankruptcy-coronavirus-car-rental.html) [link](https://www.axios.com/hertz-bankruptcy-6f16b3a4-141f-43cd-8f7b-e6a60a01d5dd.html)

It's been an interesting time for companies recently, following the Covid-19 pandemic. What has struck me is the sheer number of companies that are so precariously balanced and existing on the equivalent of paycheck-to-paycheck. The common advice that's thrown around is for companies to have ~6 months of expenses available in liquid assets in the event of a downturn. It seems that financial prudence has taken a backseat in recent times, it will be interesting to see how this may affect the financial habits of companies in the future.

## On New Evasion Techniques from Malware [link](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-encrypts-from-virtual-machines-to-evade-antivirus/)

An interesting new security evasion technique being used to avoid triggering AV programs. As mentioned in the article, behavioural monitoring from more advanced security vendors would allow these attacks to be detected and possibly mitigated through creating a virtual snapshot of the files. However, as far as I am aware, there isn't any means of interrupting the process being run on the VM to stop the encryption. The use of micro-VM's like this to run these attacks I think will become an evolving attack vector and I wouldn't be surprised if more malware started using similar techniques.

## On Security Bug Causes in the Chromium Project [link](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/memory-safety)

If I recall, Microsoft said something similar about the percentage of security bugs in their Windows code too. I wouldn't be surprised if all projects approached 70% if they were using C/C++.

## On Thread Migration for Underresourced Machines [link](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/size-matters/)

I enjoy reading about new technologies like this. I don't always understand the potential implications of these sorts of systems, but this is something I can absolutely comprehend at the surface level and can see where it could be useful not just for consumers, but business apps too.

## On Stock-Based Compensation and non-GAAP Reporting [link](https://tanay.substack.com/p/lies-damned-lies-and-stock-based)

In recent times I've taken to only looking at GAAP reporting in company financial statements. Two of the main reasons for this are that not all companies explain what is included or excluded in the non-GAAP reports, and a deeply held belief that the use of non-GAAP reporting is solely done to improve the perception of a company's bottom line, not to provide a more accurate report of the company's financial position. With stock allocation bonuses commanding such a high component of financial compensation to executives, to not represent these in reports is to actively decieve investors and analysts on the true performance of a company and the level of executive compensation. There is a direct benefit to the execs in that they can present the company in a better position, thereby increasing the value of the fiancial compensation that they removed from the non-GAAP report. What's not to love?

## On the Trigger to Starting to Productise Your Idea [link](https://www.perell.com/blog/the-five-finger-trigger)

Expanding the concept here beyond starting a business, the hardest part of most things is waiting for that "perfect moment". Rather than paralysis by analysis, instead find enough confirmation that there is opportunity, and go for it. There's more to be learned from trying and failing fast and cheap than there is from endless analysis of a problem that'll waste time you could have spent instead looking for something that was more viable.

## On Learning Kubernetes [link](https://www.learncloudnative.com/blog/2020-05-26-getting-started-with-kubernetes-part-1/)

This is less about the content of the page as opposed to the reason the page is even necessary. The submission for this mentioned that the "Getting Started" was 46 pages. The level of effort required to get started with upstream Kubernetes is significant, no wonder there are so many offerings out there that package it up into an easier installer for on-premise installations. After having several customers mention they were looking at using Kubernetes for their applications, I think this is the perfect way to demonstrate why it's easier to just use a public cloud provider or vendor offering instead.

## On Competing with AWS [link](https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/how-to-compete-with-aws/)

Take the information in this, massage it slightly and you have more or less an article on how to compete with any other entity that might potentially encroach on your business. By virtue of their size, there are some things that AWS can do that you won't have the slightest chance of competing against them at. Equally, as a small business there are things that you can achieve that AWS never would either. As mentioned in the article, don't outrun the train, dodge it.

That's all for this week
