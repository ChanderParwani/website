After a more than a month of not writing anything due to other commitments (read: procrastination and laziness), I've returned. what was originally an ambitious concept I had in my mind to start consistently writing during lockdown has come crashing back to the ground now that the worst of the restrictions are lifted. Being able to return to a mostly normal life has been great and frankly, put a lot of the ideas I had during lockdown to the back of my mind.

In trying to regain some discipline in my life, I've decided to reset my expectations for myself and what I aspire to achieve. This blog was created for me to play around with some new technologies in my life, and to carve out a small space on the internet that was mine. Anything beyond that is a bonus. Maybe a clearer direction will come in time, but for now the idea is to just write and have fun.
