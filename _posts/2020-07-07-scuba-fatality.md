Over the weekend, I was the unfortunate witness to a fatal SCUBA diving incident in Gordon's Bay in Sydney. A new diver on her first dive since gaining her entry-level (Open Water) diver certification in February passed away during a guided dive. Only seven minutes into the dive, she was found underwater, unconscious and with her breathing regulator out of her mouth. Resuscitation was atempted on the shore but failed.

## The illusion of safety

Looking at the situation, it should have been a perfectly safe dive. The swell was mild, in a sheltered bay with over 20m of visibility underwater, well in excess of what you would normally see in the area. The dive group itself consisted of the Guide and three customers. Well below the legal ratio of one guide per eight customers. Also in the water was another training group of eight divers with their instructor, two other instructors and myself as a Divemaster trainee and certified Rescue Diver on a fun dive. On the shore were two other instructors and a Divemaster. The level of experience around and the conditions would have implied the highest level of safety and yet a critical incident like this still happened. It's a sobering reminder that SCUBA diving is a higher-risk sport, and that care must always be taken. In no way am I saying that we weren't being safe or ignoring our responsibilities, just stating that vigilance is always required, even in the most perfect conditions.

## What if's

Myself and the two other instructors that I was with were originally planning to swim with the group during the dive but got frustrated waiting on the group to get in the water and decided to go off on our own. If we hadn't done so, and instead waited the extra 15 minutes for the group to get into the water and had dived with them, would the diver have been identified as in distress earlier. Would we have been able to save her? That has been rolling around the mind of myself and at least a couple of others there.

It was a sobering reminder of the risks that we take every day. I spoke with the diver before the dive. She wasn't expecting to pass away less than an hour later. I'd often thought of people dying as having had a last chance to say goodbye to their loved ones, or say their last words. Not spontaneously drowning on what should have been a safe dive. Her last words wouldn't have been anything like "tell me family I love them". It would have been something like "what sort of fish come around here". A completely unexpected incident and a tragic way to lose a life.
