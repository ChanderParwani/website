I look at a lot of different articles and posts each week, most coming in through RSS feeds. Anything that comes into my feed that I think is interesting I flag to read later on. At the end of each week I look through what I checked out during the week. These are some of the interesting articles I came across this week:

## On Virgin Australia Being Purchased [link](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/26/virgin-australia-administrators-agree-to-sell-airline-to-american-private-equity-firm-bain-capital)

One of the few examples of a large corporation living and dying by the rule of capitalism. Virgin attempted to receive bailout funding from the Australian government at the beginning of the pandemic, but was denied on the basis from the government that if it was to go into administration, someone would want to purchase it. And that's exactly what happened. To me, this is great. The idea that _if it's worth buying, it will be bought_ is, to me, one of the tenets of capitalism. Just because it's not the way you want it to go, or it's not what you value you it as is irrelevant. It's only worth as much as someone is willing to pay for it.

## On Replacing/Improving/Revolutionising Email [link](https://www.axios.com/quest-improve-email-efficiency-basecamp-slack-superhuman-67bf7b76-6db3-439d-a28c-b0e053055ab6.html)

Is email really that broken? Maybe I'm in the minority here, but I can handle my inbox pretty easily. I use my inbox as a to-do list, anything that doesn't need me to action it gets filed away into another folder. About the only thing that I want from an email client that I don't get from the Office 365 Web-App is the ability to logically group different emails into different project groups while I'm working on them. Even that isn't something overly important to me. Instead of looking at yet another tool, maybe these people should begin to re-assess how they themselves can improve their email experience.

## On Hertz and the Notion of Cars-as-a-Service [link](https://jmetz.com/2020/06/my-crazy-ass-hertz-pivot-plan-cars-as-a-service-caas/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss)

Funnily enough, I actually use a service that works somewhat similarly to this. I pay a weekly fee to use a vehicle that covers the vehicle, insurance, servicing, repairs etc. Everything except fuel, tolls and oil (if the vehicle burns oil during standard operation). Expanding on this to be able to use any car within a certain class wherever I go sounds like a decent idea. Not that there's much out of state travel happening right now, but if there was, I'd definitely look at something like this.

## On the Drop in New Vehicle Sales [link](https://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2020/06/june-vehicle-sales-forecast-29-year.html)

Seems pretty obvious really. To me, the more interesting piece of news that I heard was that a few luxury car dealers are having record levels of business - one Maserati dealer has had his biggest month ever here in Australia. It's anecdotal, but it does show the gap between what everyone else is experiencing as compared to the super rich

## On Standardisation on the Foot [link](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/multistate-disagreement-over-the-length-of-the-foot-to-end/)

I didn't even know there were two measurements for the foot, so it was an educational read for me to come across this.

## On the HCI Market [link](https://www.crn.com.au/news/nutanix-vmware-battle-for-hci-software-market-share-lead-549810)

At the beginning of the year I posited to my colleagues that the HCI market year-on-year will grow less than 25%. What was once hailed as the solution to all your storage woes has started to show its weaknesses and reaching saturation in its applicable markets. If nothing else, the fact that two vendors hold such a large portion of the market means it's fairly pointless to try compete with them - why take them on in their market when you could instead compete in an adjacent market and outgrow them? External storage array's are still going to be here for a long time and are less differentiated, but far more competitive.

## On the Narratives of Our Lives [link](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2020/05/losing-the-narrative-the-genre-fiction-of-the-professional-class/)

I never thought of our lives and culture as a genre, or how the counterculture of one generation becomes the mainstream of the next. It makes sense though, in regards to how cyclical trends are over time. Is the key to seeing where the markets are going hidden in eeing what the emerging genres are?

## On Speaking Out Against the Common Discourse [link](https://medium.com/@sarahadowney/this-politically-correct-witch-hunt-is-killing-free-speech-and-we-have-to-fight-it-7ced038d33ae) [link](https://austingwalters.com/on-committing-suicide/) [link](https://environmentalprogress.org/big-news/2020/6/29/on-behalf-of-environmentalists-i-apologize-for-the-climate-scare) [link](https://jayriverlong.github.io/2020/06/28/cancel-culture.html)

It was a common thread in the past week, people talking about being silenced or otherwise feeling unable to speak for fear of being cancelled or otherwise ostracised by those around them. Certainly I can relate to this. I've started to actively avoid posting on any social media voicing any opinions out of concern that it'll be misinterpreted or otherwise used against me in future. This website is about the only outlet I have.

## On the Payment Processing Duopoly [link](https://medium.com/swlh/the-unknown-duopoly-that-needs-breaking-up-more-than-google-f7b2c8876ea7)

Absolutely agree here. Although I will caveat that by saying that Visa and Mastercard helped create the standardisations that facilitates a lot of the international consumer transactions every day. Bitcoin was created as a means of disrupting this duopoly, but to date hasn't impacted anything. While I agree that payment processing is now a utility, so are a number of other things that also are privatised, such as internet access.

Until next time
