I look at a lot of different articles and posts each week, most coming in through RSS feeds. Anything that comes into my feed that I think is interesting I flag to read later on. At the end of each week I look through what I checked out during the week. These are some of the interesting articles I came across this week:

## On the Influence of Police Unions [link](https://reason.com/2020/06/03/its-time-to-bust-police-unions/)

Definitely an interesting article and see some of the correlations between unions and police department performance. However I take issue with the stance of the article that police unions are bad for focusing on police: _"This is what police unions do: defend the narrow interests of police at the expense of public safety."_. To me, that's the point of a union - to represent the interests of its members. They are not meant as an independent watchdog, they are meant to provide the ability for members to collectively bargain with their employers to improve their own working conditions. The issue comes from the implicit power that they have in being able to effectively hold a city ransom through threatening to remove law enforcement services. An independent watchdog service might go a long way towards providing a middle-ground between the interests of unions and menbers, and overall public safety.

## On Helium Availability During CoVid-19 [link](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.6.2.20200605a/full/)

Less interesting from a scientific perspective for me than it is from a diving perspective. Helium is used for deep diving as an additive to air to reduce the effects of nitrogen at depth. More helium would ideally mean lower prices, but it would seem that hasn't occurred as yet. Hopefully it will in future, although I don't see any indication it will.

## On How to Create and Deliver Presentations [link](http://www.jilles.net/perma/2020/06/05/presentation-rules.html)

I'm working on creating presentations at the moment. This article put into words some of the ideas I intuitively had, as well as giving me new ideas on how to overall improve my presentations.

## On Assumptions [link](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/permanent-assumptions/) and Ideas that Changed My Life [link](https://www.perell.com/blog/50-ideas-that-changed-my-life)

Completely different articles written by different people, but the theme is still the same. Having a set of ideas or concepts to help guide you is invaluable to determine where to focus effort. I don't think I agree with everything on these articles, but it gave me food for thought.

## On Consensus vs Science [link](https://glenn.thedixons.net/science/6-consensus-as-religion/)

I agree with a lot of this in theory, but as with anything, I feel that the nuances of the discussion make a significant difference. The view of whether the climate in changing is able to be verified by past measurements over time, which are objective facts. The view of how bad it will be, human influence and such are speculative in nature. We cannot divine the future and we can't create another Earth to do a double-blind test on whether emissions impact climate change. data interpretation is subjective as people add, subtract or interpret data differently based on their personal biases, experiences or economic and social influences. That doesn't mean the science is broken, it means that humans are flawed. No surprises there.

## On the Weaponization of Diversity [link](https://siliconhillslawyer.com/2020/06/03/the-weaponization-of-diversity/)

A contrarian opinion to what we're seeing from many these days. I like reading posts like these which challenge the common narrative and propse an alternative explanation. I don't entirely believe that culture is the primary issue here but I do believe that it factors in. I do believe though that the idea of short-term thinking is also a reality of people who are under economic stress. Considering the future is a luxury of the middle- and upper-class, poverty-stricken households have too mcuh focus on simply surviving day to day to have the time to consider what could lie ahead.

## On HCI for Mission-Critical Systems [link](https://www.theregister.com/2020/06/10/mission_critical_computing_hci_intel/)

I'm a firm believer that HCI as a platform is dead, it just doesn't know it yet. Software-defined storage systems and scale-out are here to stay, but the aggregation of storage and compute is going to collaps in time. Between bandwidth usage, differential scaling of compute and storage, and increased ecosystem lock-in over time, HCI is not going to be a permanent stay in the market. Not for core infrastructure at least. Perhaps at edge sites it will have a use-case, but for primary DC's and general-purpose VM infrastructure, it's approaching its death knell

## On Automation Replacing Jobs [link](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2020/06/no-recent-automation-revolution.html)

In the same way 3D printing was going to kill retail, IBM's Watson was going to kill the medical profession, and Bitcoin was going to kill the banking system, automation has been the looming axe over the head over many repetitive and manual jobs. Just like all the other hyped tehnologies, the reality didn't meet the expectation. That's not to say it never will happen, but I don't believe it'll happen in the forseeable future.
