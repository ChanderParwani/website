With a fantastic weekend behind me, I've finally recovered from it enough to start to look forward to the next one. The social whirlwind (relatively) of catching up with friends three nights out of four over the long weekend was a great way to flex those social muscles.

More importantly though, I got to use my actual muscles. Starting with a couple of easy dives on Saturday morning in the crisp chill of the ocean seeing more octopuses in a single dive than I ever have before. I swear I was coming across them every few minutes, like I had an inbuilt radar to seek them out. Follow that up with a nice, long hike, just a smidge below 27km in length on the Sunday. Rounded out with a day experiencing outdoor rock climbing for the first time on the Monday. Come the Tuesday I had the satisfying ache through my whole body that comes from achieving something and pushing boundaries.

I used to avoid hiking by myself. Not out of any safety consideration, but just because I thought that it was an activity that I would only be able to enjoy while in the company of others. After completing a couple of smaller tracks in the preceding weeks by myself, I realised how much I enjoy the opportunity to enjoy my surroundings and have the quietness and space to let my mind wander wherever it wants to go. Being able to explore at my own pace, go as hard or as slow as I like along the scenery is something I never appreciated in the past. Add to it the sense of satisfaction from completing a significant distance and a want to push further and I've come to realise I like hiking for the simple pleasure of hiking. It's lovely to share with others, but it also has its own beauty in simply going by yourself. With an intention in my mind to complete the Great North Walk this year, it's reassuring to know that no matter whether I train with others or alone, I'll enjoy it enough to keep going back.
